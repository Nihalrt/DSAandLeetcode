# DSA and LeetCode Practice

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, primarily from LeetCode.

## About

I am using this repository to track my daily LeetCode practice and improve my problem-solving skills. The `leetcode-DSA.py` file contains the code for each LeetCode problem I've solved.

## Contents

* **`leetcode-DSA.py`**: This file contains Python solutions to LeetCode problems. Each solution is typically accompanied by comments explaining the approach and logic.

## Usage

You can browse the `leetcode-DSA.py` file to see the solutions and learn from them. Feel free to clone this repository and use the code as a reference for your own LeetCode practice.

### How to use the leetcode-DSA.py file.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Nihalrt/DSAandLeetcode.git](https://github.com/Nihalrt/DSAandLeetcode.git)
    cd DSAandLeetcode
    ```
2.  **Open `leetcode-DSA.py`:** Use a text editor or IDE to view the code.
3.  **Find a problem:** The file should contain comments that indicate which LeetCode problem each solution corresponds to.
4.  **Run the code (Optional):** If you wish to test the code, you can run it using a Python interpreter. Ensure you have Python installed.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution, want to add solutions in other languages, or would like to fix a bug, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch** (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b fix/bug-fix-name`).
3.  **Make your changes.**
4.  **Commit your changes** (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
5.  **Push to the branch** (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6.  **Create a new Pull Request.**

**Guidelines:**

* Please ensure your code is well-commented and easy to understand.
* If adding a new solution, please include the LeetCode problem link in the comments.
* Try to keep code clean and follow pep8 standards.
* If adding solutions in a new language, please create a folder for that language, and include a readme file within the folder, that describes how to run your code.
